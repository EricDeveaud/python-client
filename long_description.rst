Group inference and reporting of neuroimaging studies require that individual's
features are spatially aligned into a common frame where their location can be
called standard.
To that end, a multiplicity of brain templates with anatomical annotations
(i.e., atlases) have been published.
However, a centralized resource that allows programmatic access to templates is
lacking.
TemplateFlow is a modular, version-controlled resource that allows researchers
to use templates "off-the-shelf" and share new ones.
